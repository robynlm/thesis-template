This is a template version of the Latex project for my Thesis.
My full thesis is freely accessible at: https://pure.port.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/81924744/Thesis_RLM_final.pdf
I make this publicly accessible as I hope it can be useful as templates, or inspiration, or help you figure out how to format your own thesis.
Note that as this is a heavily trimmed down version, there are numerous undefined reference warnings, you should replace these as you create your own labels and references.
