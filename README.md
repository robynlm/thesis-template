This is a template version of the Latex project for my Thesis.

My full thesis is freely accessible at: https://pure.port.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/81924744/Thesis_RLM_final.pdf

I simply hope this can be useful as a template, or inspiration, or help you figure out how to format your own thesis.

Note that as this is a heavily trimmed down version, there are numerous undefined reference warnings, you should replace these as you create your own labels and references.

Best of luck in your thesis writing <3
