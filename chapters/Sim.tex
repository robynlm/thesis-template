Here's three figures together using minipage

        \caption[Initial $\delta$ in the simulation box]{Initial distribution at $z_{IN} = 302.5$ of the density contrast $\delta$ in the simulation box, for a $\Lambda$CDM universe. The $x$, $y$, and $z >-0.25\lambda_{pert}$ region is removed exposing the centre of the over-density at $x=y=z=-0.25\lambda_{pert}$, where $\delta_{IN,\;OD}=0.03$. The full lines go through the vertices and dash-dotted lines through the centre of the edges of an octahedron centred at the over-density.}

        \caption[Radial profile of initial $\delta$]{Initial radial profile at $z_{IN} = 302.5$ of the initial density contrast $\delta$ starting from the centre of the over-density to its minimum in three different directions, towards the vertices, edges, and faces of the octahedral distribution in \Eqref{eq: Rc} plotted against the proper radius from the over-dense peak. Error bars, when visible, are indicated as shaded regions.}

        \caption[Isosurface of initial $\delta$]{Isosurface for $\delta=0.01$ in the initial distribution of the matter density contrast at $z_{IN} = 302.5$. The two different panels show different points of view. The periodic boundary conditions insure that this distribution is a lattice of over-densities connected by filaments and separated by voids.}
