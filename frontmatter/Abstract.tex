\chapter{Abstract}

\sloppy I don't want the first paragraph to be indented. Lots of text that all holds in one page. Some times I mention codes I use with the \texttt{code font}, sometimes I have a bit of maths $1+1=2$. But nice overall summary with key messages, one aspect discussed in each paragraph... I do not put references or links or acronyms in the abstract.
